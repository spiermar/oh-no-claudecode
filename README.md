## Best Practices

### Tune Instructions

You can tune instructions by adding emphasis (e.g., “IMPORTANT” or “YOU MUST”) to improve adherence.

### Permissions

### Sandboxing

### AskUserQuestion tool

```
I want to build [brief description]. Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool.

Ask about technical implementation, UI/UX, edge cases, concerns, and tradeoffs. Don't ask obvious questions, dig into the hard parts I might not have considered.

Keep interviewing until we've covered everything, then write a complete spec to SPEC.md.
```
